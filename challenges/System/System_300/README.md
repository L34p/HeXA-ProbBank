# Safe auth

Ha ha ha! Isn't it perfect? :)


ssh guest@play.hexa.pro (pw: guest)

Problem location: /home/auth/auth (<a href="https://gist.github.com/L34p/18f7f47035184b2410c7">Source code</a>)


Hint 1: You don't have to know contents of password file.

Hint 2: scanf("%256s", user_password); ... is it really safe?

Hint 3: It does not need any special technique. Just  try to input anything !
