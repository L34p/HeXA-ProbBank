Find 13th.


#### Hint

```
There are 13 children.

Each child has own id card and no(number) card.

A line of poem is written on an id card. (It may be long.)

You can ask a sentence. If you don't choose a right line of that poem, nothing will be given.

If you are right, children will keep quiet.
```

#### You should guess the "13th".
