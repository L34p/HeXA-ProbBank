# Dragonballs

http://play.hexa.pro/~web250/index.php

Collect the dragonballs. (They are scattered!)

#### Hint 
```
There are seven tables.

There are seven balls on each table.

The dragon god determines the dragonball set by their weight sum.

However, Kakarot know nothing about number.

d on d, r on r, a on a, g on g, o on o, n on n, b on b.
